ðŸ“š Book Recommender System


---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Clean and prepare the dataset (ratings, book metadata).  
2. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Extract features for similarity computation (TF-IDF, cosine similarity, etc.).  
3. **Modeling** â€“ Train and evaluate recommendation algorithms:
   - Content-based filtering  
   - Collaborative filtering  
   - Hybrid approach  
4. **Evaluation** â€“ Use metrics like RMSE, Precision@k, Recall@k to measure effectiveness.  
5. **Deployment Ready** â€“ Code structured for scaling into an API or web app.
